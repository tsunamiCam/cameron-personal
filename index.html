    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <div class="dividing-line"></div>
    <p>
      My expertise is in coastal modelling and analysing the risks associated with natural hazards.  I have extensive experience developing hydrodynamic models, particularly of coastal hazards, as well as the technical skills necessary to distil large datasets to make sense of their relevance and practical significance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My skill-base was developed first as an engineer, where I used numerical models of waves, storm surge, tides, and tsunamis to determine the hazard exposure of coastal and marine structures (see Triton Consultants Ltd.).  
    </p>
    <p>
      With my unique blend of scientific and technical engineering skills, I am well-positioned to inform complex decisions regarding insurance, engineering and emergency planning.

            More recently through my PhD, I investigated methods of predicting the building losses associated with catastrophic tsunami events. Here, I combined my modelling, data analysis and software development skills to develop probabilistic building damage models using data derived from the 2011 tsunami in Japan.
